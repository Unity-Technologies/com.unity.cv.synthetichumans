Unity applies this Agreement, at its sole discretion.

SECTION 2 - ACCEPTANCE AND MODIFICATIONS

2.1. **Acceptance.** Access to the Work and or Derivative Work(s) constitutes Your acceptance of
this Agreement, and thus determines the date at which it is effective.

2.2. **Modifications.** Unity reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or
terminate this Agreement. Unity may also modify the Agreement at any time and without
prior notice. If we modify the Agreement, we will post the modification on unity3d.com or

Agreement, a revocable, worldwide, royalty-free (except as stated in Subsection 3.8), nonsublicensable, and non-exclusive license to:

3.2. **Contributor License**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
Contributor hereby grants to You, for the duration of this Agreement, a worldwide,
revocable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free (except as stated in Subsection 3.8) patent license
to make, have made, use, import and otherwise transfer the Work and Derivative Work(s)
for Non-commercial purposes only. The license detailed in this Subsection 3.2 applies to all
patent claims licensable by such Contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by Your making, having made, using, selling, offering for sale,
importing, or otherwise transferring the Work and Derivative Work(s) alone or by
combination. If You or Your Agent institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
crossclaim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work, Derivative Work(s), or a
Contribution incorporated within the Work or Derivative Work(s) constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
Agreement for that Work, Derivative Work(s), and Contribution(s) shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.

including the attribution requirements outlined in Section 4 herein;

with any other product which is sold by You, Unity, and/or any third party;

d) disassemble, decompile, modify (except as set out in Subsection 3.5) or reverse
engineer the Work or Derivative Work(s), or permit or authorize a third party to do so;

e) use source code, executables, and/or algorithms that are included in the Work or
Derivative Work(s) to replicate their respective functionalities;

f) Share, modify, or otherwise use the Work or Derivative Work(s) in any manner that
causes any portion of the Work or Derivative Work(s) to be subject to a Mandatory
Open-Source Agreement, or to affect another product or service offered by Unity or
its Affiliates.

3.5. **Permitted Modifications**. Unity authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media
and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications

modifications authorized by this Subsection 3.5 shall not produce Derivative Work(s).

3.6. **Ownership**. You acknowledge that Unity owns all right, title, and interest to all Intellectual
Property Rights in the Work and Derivative Work(s) thereof. You hereby assign and agree
to assign to Unity all Intellectual Property Rights, as they arise, in Derivative Work(s) You
create. Should this assignment be invalid for any reason, you grant to Unity an irrevocable,
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, and royalty-free license (with the right to
grant sublicenses) under those Intellectual Property Rights to those Derivative Work(s). You
also agree to waive or refrain from asserting any author’s right, moral rights, or like rights
to the extent necessary to permit exploitation of the Derivative Work(s) by Unity or its
Affiliates. Furthermore, You agree to cooperate fully with Unity or its Affiliates, and to
execute all supplementary documents and to take all actions that are necessary to give full
force and effect to the assignment contemplated in this Subsection 3.6.

3.7. **Moral Rights**. Moral rights with respect to the Work, such as the right of integrity, are not
licensed under this Agreement, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, Unity waives and/or agrees not to assert any such
rights held by Unity to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
Rights, but not otherwise.

3.8. **Royalty Payments**. While Unity offers currently offers the rights granted to You under this
Agreement free of charge, Unity expressly reserves the right to collect royalties or other
monetary compensation in consideration of same in the future, including when the Work or
Derivative Work(s) licensed hereunder are used other than for Non-commercial purposes.

5.2. **Termination for Violation**. Your rights under this Agreement, including Licensed Rights,

**“violation”**). Where this Agreement has terminated under Subsection 5.2, it reinstates:

a) except for termination due to breach of the Code of Conduct included as Appendix A,
automatically as of the date on which the violation is cured, provided it is cured within
30 days of Your discovery of the violation. If several violations occur, each of them
must be cured within 30 days of Your discovery of each violation for the reinstatement
of Your rights under this Agreement to occur; or

b) upon express reinstatement by Unity.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Subsection 5.2 does not affect any right Unity may have to
seek remedies for You or Your Agents’ violation(s) of this Agreement.

5.3. **Effect of Termination**. Upon expiration of the 30-day cure period included in Paragraph
5.2 a), or upon termination of this Agreement for any other reason, You agree to pay all sums

facilities and/or hosting facilities.

SECTION 6 - RESPONSIBILITY, WARRANTIES, AND DISCLAIMERS

6.1. **Responsibility for Agents**. Between You and Unity, as pertains to the Work and Derivative
Work(s), You agree that you are solely responsible for all acts and omissions committed by
Your Agents.

6.2. **Your Representations and Warranties**. You represent and warrant to Unity, and Unity
depends on the fact that:

a) in exercising the rights granted herein, including the Licensed Rights, You will comply
with all applicable law and shall not infringe any proprietary rights (including
Intellectual Property Rights) of third parties;

b) you shall indemnify and hold harmless Unity, its Affiliates, as well as their respective
officers, directors, shareholders, partners, Agents, representatives, nominees, or
custodians (collectively, the **“Indemnified Parties”**) against any loss, liability or
expense incurred, without negligence on the part of the Indemnified Parties, arising
out of or in connection with your use of the Work, Derivative Work(s), or the rights
granted herein.

6.3. **No Representation or Warranties**. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by Unity, to
the maximum extent possible, Unity offers the Work or Derivative Work(s) as-is and asavailable and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work or
Derivative Work(s), whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
errors or malfunctions whether now known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer will only apply to You to the permitted
extent.

6.4. **Limitation of Liability**. To the extent possible, in no event will Unity be liable to You under
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct,
special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs,
expenses, or damages arising out of this Agreement or use of the Work, even if Unity has
been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a
limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation will only apply to You

Sections 3 or 4 of this Agreement, Unity or its Affiliates may be without an adequate remedy
at law. You therefore agree that in the event of such a breach hereof, Unity may elect to
institute and prosecute proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce specific
performance or to enjoin the continuing breach hereof. By seeking or obtaining any such
relief, Unity shall not be precluded from seeking or obtaining any other relief to which it
may be entitled.

SECTION 7 - GENERAL

7.1. **Terms of Agreement**. Unity shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed to in writing by Unity. Any
arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Work not stated herein are
